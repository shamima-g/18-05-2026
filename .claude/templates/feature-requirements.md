## Backend Integration

<!--
Mirror of `context.backendConnectivity` from the intake manifest. Populated when INTAKE Step 4e (api-connectivity-agent Call B) ran and produced Shape 2 (verified) or Shape 3 (captured but unverified). Replace this section with "No backend integration — see manifest dataSource" when dataSource is `mock-only` or `new-api`.

The manifest is the source of truth — this section exists so reviewers can see backend integration alongside the rest of the FRS without opening a JSON file.
